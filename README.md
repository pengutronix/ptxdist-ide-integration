PTXdist IDE Integration
=======================

When an IDE is used to develop an application for a PTXdist BSP then the
IDE must be configured correctly. PTXdist can export the necessary
information with `ptxdist full-bsp-report`. The tools here use that to
generate IDE specific configuration files.
